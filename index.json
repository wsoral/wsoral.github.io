These conspiracy theories can be viewed as manifestations of a collective conspiracy mentality, a collective mental state in which other groups, nations, or institutions are viewed as ill-intended and willing to conspire against the in-group. This state is instigated by salient historical representations of one’s own group (e.g., nation), viewing the in-group as a victim of others. It is boosted by a special kind of defensive in-group identity—collective narcissism. Finally, it bears negative consequences for inter-group relations.","tags":[],"title":"The Collective Conspiracy Mentality in Poland","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" In this tutorial, I\u0026rsquo;ll share my top 10 tips for getting started with Academic:\nTip 1 \u0026hellip;\nTip 2 \u0026hellip;\n","date":1536444000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1536444000,"objectID":"6a451186c775f5f0adb3a0416d0cb711","permalink":"/tutorial/example/","publishdate":"2018-09-09T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/tutorial/example/","section":"tutorial","summary":"In this tutorial, I\u0026rsquo;ll share my top 10 tips for getting started with Academic:\nTip 1 \u0026hellip;\nTip 2 \u0026hellip;","tags":null,"title":"Example Page","type":"docs"},{"authors":["Wiktor Soral","Michał Bilewicz","Mikołaj Winiewski"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1509577200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1509577200,"objectID":"a323d81397d7673f07d1c43caa63e796","permalink":"/publication/exposure_ab/","publishdate":"2017-11-02T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/exposure_ab/","section":"publication","summary":"In three studies (two representative nationwide surveys, N = 1,007, N = 682; and one experimental, N = 76) we explored the effects of exposure to hate speech on outgroup prejudice. Following the General Aggression Model, we suggest that frequent and repetitive exposure to hate speech leads to desensitization to this form of verbal violence and subsequently to lower evaluations of the victims and greater distancing, thus increasing outgroup prejudice. In the first survey study, we found that lower sensitivity to hate speech was a positive mediator of the relationship between frequent exposure to hate speech and outgroup prejudice. In the second study, we obtained a crucial confirmation of these effects. After desensitization training individuals were less sensitive to hate speech and more prejudiced toward hate speech victims than their counterparts in the control condition. In the final study, we replicated several previous effects and additionally found that the effects of exposure to hate speech on prejudice were mediated by a lower sensitivity to hate speech, and not by lower sensitivity to social norms. Altogether, our studies are the first to elucidate the effects of exposure to hate speech on outgroup prejudice.

We presented participants with preselected examples of hate speech from the Internet and other mass media and assessed their willingness to support the prohibition of public expressions of such remarks. Both studies found that social dominance orientation and right‐wing authoritarianism are positively correlated with outgroup prejudice, but they have differential effects on hate‐speech prohibition. Social dominance orientation was positively related to the acceptance of hate speech, whereas right‐wing authoritarianism was positively related to hate‐speech prohibition. In discussing this counterintuitive finding, we suggest that right‐wing authoritarians are particularly vigilant toward norm violations—and this makes them more punitive toward counternormative expressions of prejudice, such as hate speech","tags":[],"title":"When Authoritarians Confront Prejudice.

Its popularity has outbursted since the release of an SPSS/SAS macro PROCESS. PROCESS is easy to use and allows to fit a variety of models. However, it lacks certain capabilities (like ability to fit multilevel models or generalized regression models or mix of both). Also PROCESS cannot handle Bayesian moderation analysis. One can use JASP to conduct Baysian regression analysis with interaction terms, but sadly it’s post-processing capabilities are quite limited (at least to me).\nIn this post I will show, how to easily and in just a few steps fit Bayesian moderation model in R. As some of my colleagues admitted lack of R package that would replace PROCESS is one of the major factors that restrains them from swapping SPSS with R. Actually there are certain packages that aspire to replace PROCESS in R.
