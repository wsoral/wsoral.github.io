Its popularity has outbursted since the release of an SPSS/SAS macro PROCESS. PROCESS is easy to use and allows to fit a variety of models. However, it lacks certain capabilities (like ability to fit multilevel models or generalized regression models or mix of both). Also PROCESS cannot handle Bayesian moderation analysis. One can use JASP to conduct Baysian regression analysis with interaction terms, but sadly it’s post-processing capabilities are quite limited (at least to me).\nIn this post I will show, how to easily and in just a few steps fit Bayesian moderation model in R. As some of my colleagues admitted lack of R package that would replace PROCESS is one of the major factors that restrains them from swapping SPSS with R. Actually there are certain packages that aspire to replace PROCESS in R. Here, however I would to show you that you don’t need to use a specialized package and you can go on with a quite general one - brms.\nLets start with something relatively simple and easy to follow.\nContinuous and categorical predictors In this post I will extensively use tidyverse.\n# install.packages(\u0026quot;tidyverse\u0026quot;) # install.packages(\u0026quot;carData\u0026quot;) library(tidyverse) library(carData) # for an example dataset data(Moore) Moore %\u0026gt;% glimpse() ## Observations: 45 ## Variables: 4 ## $ partner.status \u0026lt;fct\u0026gt; low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low,… ## $ conformity \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; 8, 4, 8, 7, 10, 6, 12, 4, 13, 12, 4, 13, 7, 9, 9,… ## $ fcategory \u0026lt;fct\u0026gt; low, high, high, low, low, low, medium, medium, l… ## $ fscore \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; 37, 57, 65, 20, 36, 18, 51, 44, 31, 36, 42, 56, 2… By default contrast are set to contr.treatment. This means that a \\(j\\) regression coefficient a categorical variable is interpreted as a difference of means between a level \\(j+1\\) of the variable and a reference level \\(1\\).\ncontrasts(Moore$partner.status) ## low ## high 0 ## low 1 We switch contrasts to contr.sum for the categorical variable.\ncontrasts(Moore$partner.status) \u0026lt;- \u0026quot;contr.sum\u0026quot; contrasts(Moore$partner.status) ## [,1] ## high 1 ## low -1 We standardize the continuous variable - fscore.\nMoore %\u0026gt;% mutate(fscore_c = (fscore - mean(fscore))/sd(fscore)) -\u0026gt; Moore We fit our model with brms package. Both installation and fitting may take a while.\nlibrary(brms) theme_set(theme_default()) We will use weakly informative priors for regression coefficients. By defaults brms uses robust Student-t prior for model error. Robust means here robust to potential outliers.\nprior \u0026lt;- prior(normal(0, 10), class = b) Fitting is quite straigthforward. If your run your model on your laptop with less than 4 cores, it is better to change the value of cores to 2 or even 1.\n# install.packages(\u0026quot;brms\u0026quot;) fit1 \u0026lt;- brm(data = Moore, conformity ~ partner.status * fscore_c, ## means partner.status + fscore_c + partner.status:fscore_c prior = prior, sample_prior = T, chains = 4, cores = 4) We can start with printing summary of posterior distribution of our model’s coefficients.\nfit1 %\u0026gt;% posterior_summary() %\u0026gt;% broom::tidy() %\u0026gt;% filter(str_detect(.rownames, \u0026quot;^[b|si]\u0026quot;)) %\u0026gt;% mutate_if(is.numeric, round, digits= 3) %\u0026gt;% mutate(.rownames = str_replace(.rownames, \u0026quot;^b_\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;\u0026quot;)) %\u0026gt;% rename(Parameter = .rownames) %\u0026gt;% knitr::kable()   Parameter Estimate Est.Error Q2.5 Q97.5    Intercept 12.132 0.705 10.738 13.517  partner.status1 2.134 0.699 0.743 3.499  fscore_c -0.294 0.722 -1.709 1.147  partner.status1:fscore_c -1.862 0.724 -3.277 -0.448  sigma 4.689 0.525 3.799 5.849    Compare it to our prior distribution.\nprior_summary(fit1) %\u0026gt;% select(prior:coef) %\u0026gt;% knitr::kable()   prior class coef    normal(0, 10) b    b fscore_c   b partner.status1   b partner.status1:fscore_c  student_t(3, 12, 10) Intercept   student_t(3, 0, 10) sigma     To better understand our prior assumptions, it is worth to summarise sampled prior distribution.\nfit1 %\u0026gt;% posterior_summary() %\u0026gt;% broom::tidy() %\u0026gt;% filter(str_detect(.rownames, \u0026quot;^prior\u0026quot;)) %\u0026gt;% mutate_if(is.numeric, round, digits= 3) %\u0026gt;% rename(Parameter = .rownames) %\u0026gt;% knitr::kable()   Parameter Estimate Est.Error Q2.5 Q97.5    prior_b 0.164 9.970 -19.263 19.817  prior_sigma 10.854 12.209 0.339 40.729    From the table, we can see that prior to analysing the data we expected regression coefficients to be somewhere between -20 to 20. Similarly, we expected sigma (standard deviation of the regression residuals) to be within a range 0.3 to 40.6.\nSometimes you may find these prior values unplausible, i.e. too small or too large. In such instance, it is good to repeat the analysis several times, each time with different prior distribution, and examine how this affects your posterior results. This approach is called sensitivity analysis. If the results hold under varying prior choices we may say that it is robust.\nIn my field (social psychology), after finding significant interaction, we usually want to understand it’s meaning. This can be approach in two ways.\nThe first is graphical analysis and plotting model predictions. In second approach, we test the value of the focal predictor parameter under different values of the moderating variable.\nLets say we are interested in the effect of partner status (low vs. high) for individuals with varying levels of F scores. We can plot such comparisons for different values of the F score (usually mean and +/- SD, but you can use any reasonable values).\nmarginal_effects(fit1, \u0026quot;partner.status:fscore_c\u0026quot;) In the second approach, we test parameters of partner status for some fixed values of F score. In the table you can find the results. The Star indicates whether 95% credible interval of the sampled distribution does not contain 0. The Evid.Ratio column is Bayes Factor (computed via the Savage-Dickey density ratio method). Here it estimates the strength of evidence that the effect is equal to 0. If you would like to examine the ratio in favor of the alternative hypothesis (the effect is different from 0), you can simply check the revers 1/Evid.Ratio. For example, Evid.Ratio of 0.002 indicates that the strength of evidence in favor of alternative hypothesis is equal to 500. The Post.Prob is a probability that the effect is 0. If you would like to calculate probability that the effect is not 0, you can simply calculate 1-Post.Prob.\nss1 \u0026lt;- hypothesis(fit1, c(high_F_score=\u0026quot;partner.status1 + partner.status1:fscore_c = 0\u0026quot;, medium_F_score=\u0026quot;partner.status1 = 0\u0026quot;, low_F_score=\u0026quot;partner.status1 - partner.status1:fscore_c = 0\u0026quot;)) ss1$hypothesis %\u0026gt;% knitr::kable(digits = 3)   Hypothesis Estimate Est.Error CI.Lower CI.Upper Evid.Ratio Post.Prob Star    high_F_score 0.272 0.982 -1.620 2.164 13.785 0.932   medium_F_score 2.134 0.699 0.743 3.499 0.190 0.160 *  low_F_score 3.996 1.031 1.987 6.096 0.005 0.004 *    If you would like to find the effect of F score given different values of partner status, the analysis is straightforward.\nmarginal_effects(fit1, \u0026quot;fscore_c:partner.status\u0026quot;) We print the results of simple slopes analysis.\nss2 \u0026lt;- hypothesis(fit1, c(high_partner_status=\u0026quot;fscore_c + partner.status1:fscore_c = 0\u0026quot;, low_partner_status=\u0026quot;fscore_c - partner.status1:fscore_c = 0\u0026quot;)) ss2$hypothesis %\u0026gt;% knitr::kable(digits = 3)   Hypothesis Estimate Est.Error CI.Lower CI.Upper Evid.Ratio Post.Prob Star    high_partner_status -2.157 1.054 -4.150 -0.001 1.571 0.611 *  low_partner_status 1.568 0.989 -0.355 3.496 4.325 0.812      ","date":1549843200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1549843200,"objectID":"84f5f8b2c0450df26612277bdf210f41","permalink":"/post/test/","publishdate":"2019-02-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/test/","section":"post","summary":"This post is the first of a series of short tutorials on how to approach statistical analyses common among social psychologist using Bayesian approach and R package - brms\nModeration analysis is one the most widely used tools to approach interactions in regression models with at least 1 continuous term.

Following the General Aggression Model, we suggest that frequent and repetitive exposure to hate speech leads to desensitization to this form of verbal violence and subsequently to lower evaluations of the victims and greater distancing, thus increasing outgroup prejudice. In the first survey study, we found that lower sensitivity to hate speech was a positive mediator of the relationship between frequent exposure to hate speech and outgroup prejudice. In the second study, we obtained a crucial confirmation of these effects. After desensitization training individuals were less sensitive to hate speech and more prejudiced toward hate speech victims than their counterparts in the control condition. In the final study, we replicated several previous effects and additionally found that the effects of exposure to hate speech on prejudice were mediated by a lower sensitivity to hate speech, and not by lower sensitivity to social norms. Altogether, our studies are the first to elucidate the effects of exposure to hate speech on outgroup prejudice.
